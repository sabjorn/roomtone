# Roomtone
## Technical Outline
This installation was designed to utilize standard sound equipment. All components (with the exception of the control computer) are likely to be available for rental from an AV company. If a computer is unavailable, the artist is able to supply one.

* 1 x computer
* 4 x powered loud speakers
* 1 x external sound card
* 1 x microphone
* 1 x microphone pre-amp

### Computer
This machine must be able to interface with the selected external sound card and run Max/MSP. The computer should ideally be out of site in another room or enclosed in a cabinet (with proper airflow).

### Powered Loud Speakers
These can be basically any brand and size. Just remember, larger speakers can always be turned down. 

Speakers should be placed in the corners of the room on stands, all rotated toward the centre and at the same height. Any logos should be covered to reduce distractions.

### External Sound Card
Sound card should have minimum:

* 1xInput
* 4xOutputs

The soundcard should be located with the computer, and out of sight.

The microphone is connected into the input and the 4 speakers are connected to the outputs.

### Microphone
A **Shure SM58** is likely the best choice. Microphone should be hung (by the microphone cable) from centre of the room. It should hang at a height which prevents people from grabbing it and also allows for as large as possible listening area.

Basically, put the microphone up as high as possible within the space without it being directly taped to the ceiling.

### Pre-Amp
The microphone needs to be amplified for the installation. An amp with a large range of gain values is ideal since the mic gain is one of the main parameters for configuring the piece. 

The pre-amp should be located with the computer and sound card, out of sight.

If a dedicated pre-amp cannot be found, a small audio mixer can be used.

**Note**: If the selected sound card has a microphone pre-amp built in, a dedicated amp will not be necessary.

### Cables
All cables should be neatly routed from each device to the sound card. If possible, run the cables along the ceiling in straight lines. However, if this is not possible, run the cables along the edges of the space.

Basically, the cables are part of the piece but they should not be distracting and should not be a tripping hazard.
